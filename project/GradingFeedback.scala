      |In principle, this can only arise if you changed some names or types in the code that we
      |provide, for instance a method name or a parameter type.
      |
      |To diagnose your problem, perform the following steps:
      | - Run the tests that we provide with our hand-out. These tests verify that all names and
      |   types are correct. In case these tests pass, but you still see this message, please post
      |   a report on the forums [1].
      | - Take a careful look at the error messages from the Scala compiler below. They should give
